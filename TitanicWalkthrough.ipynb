Maybe we would like to submit it to a data mining programming competition, or write a research paper saying how wonderfully accurate it is, or just simply finish the Titanic project. So we need to say how accurate it is. It would be tempting to report the accuracy we just computed that used our test set. But the problem is, we spent a lot of time **tuning** our classifier **on** that test set. Of course it will do well on that test set. This accuracy may not reflect the true accuracy of our classifier on other data. So often a **second test set** is used. And this is what the Titanic `test.csv` file is. In the Titanic test dataset we don't even know the correct classification, so we cannot use it for tuning. But I can use the results you get from running your classifier on the second test set to determine the accuracy of your classifier.\n",
